# z1-test

This repository is a test repository.  It was created for experimentation and learning Git, including practicing with frontend and backend components.

## Purpose

This repository was created to practice various Git commands and workflows, specifically in the context of a simple web application with a frontend and backend. It serves as a sandbox for testing and demonstrating Git functionality with different parts of a project.

## Contents

This repository contains a basic web application structure:

*   **frontend/**: Contains the frontend code (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, possibly a framework like React, Vue, or Angular).
*   **backend/**: Contains the backend code (e.g., Python, Node.js, etc.).  This might be a simple API or server-side logic.

The specific content within these folders is primarily for demonstration and Git practice.

## How to Run (for testing purposes)

This section describes how to run the frontend and backend components for testing purposes.

### Frontend

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  Install dependencies (if any - adapt to your frontend technology):

    ```bash
    npm install  # Example for Node.js projects
    ```

3.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start  # Example for Node.js projects; could be another command
    ```

    This should start the frontend development server, usually on a specific port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

### Backend

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  Install dependencies (if any - adapt to your backend technology):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Example for Python projects
    npm install # Example for Node.js projects
    ```

3.  Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    python app.py  # Example for Python Flask app
    node server.js # Example for Node.js app
    ```

    This should start the backend server, usually on a different port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

**Note:**  The exact commands for running the frontend and backend will depend on the specific technologies used in each.  Replace the example commands above with the actual commands needed for your project.  Be sure to include these details in your README.
